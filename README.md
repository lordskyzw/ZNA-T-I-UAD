Zimbabwe National Army aims to bring about a product that analyzes the usage of network resources in a given network. The project is divided into two parts: the first part is data analysis. 
The sample data was collected from a private collection and is provided as is.
The data analysis is found in the jupyter notebooks.
The second part is the prediction of usage and the anomalies detection
The prediction is done using Facebook's Prophet library and the anomalies detection is done using the Isolation Forest algorithm.
The project is still in development and is not yet ready for production use. The project is open source and anyone can contribute to it.
