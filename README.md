# Zimbabwe National Army Network Resource Analyzer

## Overview
The **Zimbabwe National Army** aims to develop a product that analyzes the usage of network resources within a given network. This project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Data Analysis**
2. **Prediction and Anomaly Detection**

---

## Data Analysis
The sample data for this project was collected from a private collection and is provided as is. The data analysis component is thoroughly documented in the provided Jupyter notebooks. This phase involves:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand usage patterns.
- Visualizing the data to gain insights into network resource usage.

---

## Prediction and Anomaly Detection
The second part of the project focuses on predicting future network resource usage and detecting anomalies. This phase includes:

- **Prediction**: Utilizing Facebook's Prophet library to forecast future usage trends.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implementing the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify unusual patterns in the data that could indicate anomalies.

---

## Implementation
The current implementation is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. This allows for easy deployment and scalability of the application.

---

## Project Status
The project is still in development and not yet ready for production use. We are continuously working on improving the accuracy of predictions and the robustness of anomaly detection.

---
